"""
Health check endpoints for monitoring and orchestration.

Provides health check endpoints following best practices for
Kubernetes and cloud-native deployments:

- /health: Basic health check with system information
- /health/live: Liveness probe (is the application running?)
- /health/ready: Readiness probe (can the application serve traffic?)

These endpoints are used by:
- Load balancers for routing decisions
- Kubernetes for pod lifecycle management
- Monitoring systems for alerting
- Health check services for uptime monitoring
